#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program, and software is functional and secure by creating tests and test suites. By creating automated tests that verify pass and fail situations according to the software requirements I can both test for functionality and that it meets requirements. Automation testing also allows me to run those changes anytime the code is changed which verifies that any change I make does not ultimately break functionality or stray from the requirements.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program goes back to testing the code, program, and software against the requirements for both pass and fail situations. By testing the code against the requirements and verifying that they all align I am in fact meeting and incorporating the user needs into the code.

#How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by meeting the requirements in the simplest way or in other words not over embellishing my code and unintentionally adding in errors/bugs that will result in a failure. I also take the approach of ensuring I test my code, program, and software with a tester mentality and not simply as the developer so that I do not incorporate bias into the tests. Lastly I always act profesionally with discipline as if not only monetary losses could result from my errors but also the loss of human lives. Approaching software design from this mindset allows me to take every precaution I can and give the utmost attention to detail that will allow me to create an error/bug free product.
